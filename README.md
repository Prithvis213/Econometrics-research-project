# Econometrics-research-project

In this project, we have done an in-depth analysis in order to answer the research question "How do drunk driving laws affect traffic deaths". Initially we conduct a basic exploratory data analysis to gain an understanding of what the data is telling us. We then formulate different economic theories based on the data and choose relevant data concerned with the research hypothesis. As part of the process, we check for cases of endogeneity as we would not be able to proceed with the model selection unless those cases have been handled. We then run different regression models and come up with the best case solution to answer the question appropriately. The initial and primary model of concern we have chosen is for the case of alcohol involved vehicle fatality rates, because that forms the crux of this research. We then check the cases for vehicle fatality rates as a whole and the fatality rates for each group in order to gain a better understanding as to how the laws affect the traffic deaths. 
After this, forming a holistic picture, we present a conclusion.
